# Computer-aided diagnosis of sacroillitis in CT scans: method and preliminary results

## Abstract
Sacroiliitis is the inflammation of the sacroiliac joint, characterized by a lower
back pain. Early diagnosis of the condition can lead to preventive treatment
which can significantly improve the patientâ€™s quality of life on the long run.
However, if it is diagnosed late, the damage in the joint is irreversible, and
the patient could suffer of chronic pain in the lower back as well as limited
mobility. The detection of the condition in its early stages is a difficult task,
as the differences between a healthy and inflammated joint in the early stages
are very subtle. Here we propose a method for the automatic segmentation and
diagnosis of the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) in CT images. We have tried our method
in 300 different joint images and achieved a successful segmentation for 61.6%
of the cases and a classification accuracy of 55.3% in the healthy joints and of
63.6% for the sick ones.
